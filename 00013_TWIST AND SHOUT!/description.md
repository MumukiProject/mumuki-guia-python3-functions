A well-known band - in order to add various screams to their song - asked us to develop a `shout` function, which takes a string and returns it in uppercase with an exclamation mark.

For example:

```python
ãƒ shout("twist")
"TWIST!"
```

> Define the `shout` function. Remember the `str.upper` function that converts a string to uppercase.
