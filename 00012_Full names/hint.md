Remember that we can find out the length of strings using `len`...

```python
ムlen("library")
7
ムlen("babel")
5
```

...and we can also _concatenate_ them, i.e. get **a new one** that joins two strings together:

```python
ム"aa" + "bb"
"aabb"
ム"their shelves " + "record all combinations"
"their shelves record all combinations"
```
