- when:
    these_expectations_failed:
    - "* Not:Uses:startswith"
  then: ":warning: in this exercise you don't need `str.startswith`. We tell you only
    as an example :wink:"
- when:
    these_tests_failed:
    - Contemplate the space
  then: It seems that you are not contemplating space; the `full_name_length` must
    return `1` more than the summed lengths of `first_name` and `lastname`
