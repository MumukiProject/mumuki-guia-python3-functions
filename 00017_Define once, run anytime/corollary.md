As we can see, the functions have a _name_ (in this case `is_longer_than`) that we will have to _devise_ when defining the function, and then write it exactly the same every time we use it.

It's very important that this name be _intention-revealing_, that is, that it be clear and reflect the intention of the function. For example, if the function tells us whether a word is capitalized:

* :heavy_check_mark: `is_upper_case` might be a good name;
* :x: `asdf` or `iupcase` are bad names.

But what is `def` and `return`? And those colons? Let's learn about the syntax!
