Congrats! Those similarities aren't accidental: to define functions, you must follow some _syntactic_ rules! :straight_ruler:

1. The first line, also called the header:
  1. must start with the `def` keyword (short for _define_);
  2. then, the name of the function must be written;
  3. then, between parentheses and separated by commas, the _parameters_ that the function is going to have - and that will later allow it to receive _arguments_ when calling it - must be written;
  4. and finally, it must end with a colon (`:`)
2. The following lines (also called _body_) must:
  1. be indented, that is, not directly against the margin, but by pressing the `Tab â†¹` key;
  2. the last line in particular must also start with `return`, followed by the expression out function will return.

Wow, so many rules :tired_face:! But don't worry, little by little we'll master them :smile:
