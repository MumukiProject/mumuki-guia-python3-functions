When we program, the commands we already know are usually not enough by themselves to solve a real problem. But is there anything that prevents us from _combining_ them? :thinking: Of course not! :handshake:

For example, there's nothing in Python that tells us if two texts are the same length. But we can find out by combining `len` with `==`:

```python
ムlen("drums") == len("guitar")
False
ムlen("piano") == len("flute")
True
```

> * `"Lago Titicaca"` is longer than `"Río Grande"`
> * `"Atacama"` is longer than `"Cuyo"`
> * `"Tierra del Fuego"` is longer than `"Santiago del Estero"`
