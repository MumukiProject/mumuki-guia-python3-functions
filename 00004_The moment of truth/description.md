The moment has finally arrived! We'll write our first function from scratch.

But don't despair :scream:: if something doesn't work out, remember that you can submit your code as many times as you need, try it in the console, look at the previous exercises and check the hints! :wink:

> Define the function `is_high_noon`, which takes an hour and tells us if it is `12`:
>
> ```python
> ムis_high_noon(0)
> False
> ムis_high_noon(11)
> False
> ムis_high_noon(12)
> True
> ムis_high_noon(23)
> False
> ```
>
> Then test it in the console. When you have finished, press submit.
