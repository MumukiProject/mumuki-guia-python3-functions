Great! :tada:

In this lesson, we talked about the importance of choosing intention-revealing names for our functions. That goes for parameters, too!

For example, if you choose `number` as the name for the parameter `is_high_noon`, that's fine. However, a better name would be `hour` or `an_hour`, since that's what it represents. :wink:

```python
def is_high_noon(hour):
  return hour == 12
```
