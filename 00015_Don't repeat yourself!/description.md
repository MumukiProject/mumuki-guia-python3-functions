Combining operations is very useful, but it has the problem that we have to remember (or think :thought_balloon:) how to do it every time we need it. This can lead us to make mistakes...


```python
# we want to know if the first is longer than the second
ムlen("Durazno") < len("Canelones")
True # Oops it was the other way!
```
...or to simply get bored by doing the same thing over and over again :rolling_eyes:. Wouldn't it be much better if we could write directly like this?:

```python
ムis_longer_than("Durazno", "Canelones")
```

> :octagonal_sign: Wait! is this going to work? Find out by testing it on the console.
