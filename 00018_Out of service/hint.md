Let's review the rules:

1. The header:
  1. must start with the keyword `def` (yes, lowercase);
  2. then, the name of the function should go;
  3. then, between parentheses, the _parameters_ should go;
  4. and finally, a colon (`:`)
2. Body lines must:
  1. start indented using the `Tab â†¹` key;
  2. the last line in particular must also start with `return`, followed by what we want to return
