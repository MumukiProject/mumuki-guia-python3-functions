Very good! ðŸ¤¬ You may have noticed that Python prints messages like this when it doesn't understand your code:

```
  File "solution.py", ...
	def half(a_number)
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

Even though they seem a bit cryptic at first glance, they're actually very helpful texts! Usually, the `^` symbol is placed exactly where something is missing (for example, the colon `:`) or right after something that is misspelled. Of course, it's not always perfect and we can't ask for that much either. :face_with_hand_over_mouth:

But now that our code works, we'll give you something to think about: What does the `half` function return? A boolean value or something else? What about `sum_lengths`? Try it in the console to get rid of the doubts. :wink:
