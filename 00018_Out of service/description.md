And what happens if we don't follow the rules we just saw when defining a function? :speak_no_evil:  The computer will refuse to learn the task we just taught it!

This is known as a _syntax error_ - or `SyntaxError` in Python -, which we will represent by the symbol <i class="fas fa-minus-circle text-broken"></i>. As we learn to program, we will run into this kind of errors many, many times, but don't despair! If we read our code with patience and attention, we can solve it.

> 3. :tools: fix syntax errors and resubmit.
