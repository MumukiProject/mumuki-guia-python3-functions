Let's define more functions! :writing_hand: Dani - who loves the first day of every month :date: - defined this function...

```python
def is_favorite_day(day_of_month):
  return day_of_month == 1
```

...and uses it like this (_and has left it in the library for you_):

```python
ムis_favorite_day(13)
False
ムis_favorite_day(1)
True
```

> Now it's your turn! Dani also says that someone `loves_reading`, when the number of books they remember reading is greater than 20. For example:
>
> ```python
> ムloves_reading(15)
> False
>
> ムloves_reading(45)
> True
> ```
>
> Define and test the function `loves_reading` in the console.
